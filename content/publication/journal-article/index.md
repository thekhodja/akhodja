abstract: Self-disinfecting materials have become increasingly important in the wake of the COVID-19pandemic. They are used in personal protective equipment and can be applied to varioussurfaces such as in academic environments and clinical settings to eliminate pathogens.Carbon nanodots (CDs) are a promising solution because of their low toxicity towardsmammalian cells and their antimicrobial properties. In our study, cellulose-based fibers suchas cotton and paper were modified with various CDs to enhance their antibacterial properties.CDs derived from naturally occurring antibacterial compounds like curcumin and piperinewere synthesized and functionalized with phenylboronic acid (PBA). These functionalized CDscharacterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetricanalysis (TGA), UV-VIS spectroscopy, fluorescence spectrophotometry, zeta-potentialanalysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-Ray analysis (EDX).The antibacterial efficacy of the synthesized CDs solutions was evaluated against grampositive (Staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram negative (Escherichia coli) bacterial strains inthe presence and absence of UV radiation. Results showed that curcumin-phenyl boronicbased CDs (PBA-CCMCD) and piperine based-CDs (PBA-PPCD) have notable antibacterialefficacy both in solution and when grafted onto fibers against the bacterial strains. In theabsence of light, the IC50 of PBA-PPCD solution was 0.4 mg/mL for E. coli and 0.5 mg/mL forS. epidermidis, while for PBA-CCMCD solution it was 1 mg/mL for both strains. Under UV light(365 nm), the IC50 of PBA-PPCD solution was 0.5 mg/mL for both strains while for PBA-CCMCDsolution it was 0.7 mg/mL for E. coli and 1 mg/mL for S. epidermidis. Subsequently, the CDswere attached onto cellulose fibers and the antibacterial activity of the newly modified fiberswere also evaluated; filter paper discs were used as a model for cellulose fibers When fiberswere treated with CDs (20 μL, 50 mg/mL), the growth of S. epidermidis or E. coli (20 μL; 5 x105cfu/mL) was inhibited after being exposed to UV light for two hours. These findings suggestthat carbon dots can be an effective way to introduce antibacterial properties into cellulose-based fabrics.
