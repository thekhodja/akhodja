## About Me

Hey, my name is Abdelhamid Khodja - but most people just call me Bioman! Originally hailing from Algeria ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡¿, Iâ€™m a recent Biology graduate from the American University of Sharjah - graduating as the 2024 Class Valedictorian. 

Currently, my research interests include computational structural biology, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, protein and drug design. During my time at AUS, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant to Dr. Mohammad Al-Sayah where I was awarded three prestigious research grants for my work on developing, synthesizing, and testing novel antibacterial nanoparticles to create self-disinfecting fabrics.

Coming from a strong experimental background, I'm hoping to have this website serve as my professional portfolio and a way for me to blog my journey as I shift to computational biology. I hope to provide a roadmap to others who are interested in my journey and also find themselves in a similar position.
